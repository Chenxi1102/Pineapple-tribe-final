[Data](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/marriage) we worked with is from fivethirtyeight.com. Source of all data is Decennial Census (from 1960 to 2000), and American Community Survey (from 2001-2012), via [IPUMS USA](https://usa.ipums.org/usa/cite.shtml).

This data contains some useful data of marriage and divorce rate across different factors including sex, age, race, education level, region (in the U.S.), income level and whether the couple has kids or not. Notice that some of the factors mentioned above might not included in the marriage/divorce data set.

Please read the summary page for more insights of marriage and divorce.
